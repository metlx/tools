** scan types
#+begin_src bash
When port scanning with Nmap, there are three basic scan types. These are:

    TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
    SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)
    UDP Scans (-sU)

Additionally there are several less common port scan types, some of which we will also cover (albeit in less detail). These are:

    TCP Null Scans (-sN)
    TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
    TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)

Most of these (with the exception of UDP scans) are used for very similar purposes, however, the way that they work differs between each scan. This means that, whilst one of the first three scans are likely to be your go-to in most situations, it's worth bearing in mind that other scan types exist.

In terms of network scanning, we will also look briefly at ICMP (or "ping") scanning.
